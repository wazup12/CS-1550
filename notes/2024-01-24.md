## What Causes Interrupts
- exceptions (see [previous](./2024-01-10.md))
  - hardware originated (CPU)
- syscalls
  - software originated
  - since this "elevates" an action from user space to kernal space
  - anything representing an address means the OS may not be running the code + it may put a program in privileged mode

## Managing Interrupts
1. SYSCALL puts CPU in kernel mode 
2. lookup type of interrupt from **interrupt vector** (maps interrupt type to an OS address)
3. We tell the CPU to invoke a syscall by using the syscall commmand
4. We identify the syscall (to the OS) by numbering them
5. The OS uses the syscall table to  map the syscall number (ordinals) to the code
6. Return from interrupt state

Circular problem -- in order to set interrupt vector, its privileged (to be the OS, you need to be the OS)
- Therefore, one must know the initial state of the program

Initial state is privileged mode (i.e., the OS MUST be the first piece of software)

## Throwing Parties Analogy
- JAL vs SYSCALL

When you call a function, most of the prior states should be preserved (stack pointer, registers) -- *THE CALLING CONVENTION*

We have to store register values onto the stack, which is in the address space. The address space is the program's allocation of RAM

The registers are right next to the CPU which is why they are faster

OS uses same registers and resources as the program -- meaning the OS overwrites the program's "exclusive" resources
- Thus, the OS must perform a context switch [Save and restore all the resources (TO RAM) that the program believes is exclusive]

*for the purposes of this course, we believe that the context switch's speed is expensive and we can not modify it*

Design Space - the enumeration of all designs -- we will examine opposing ends of the design space to figure out which solutions are best fit for which situations

## Monolithic vs Microkernel
### Monolithic
- data structure uses algo to find next instruction, then OS executes
- the code to traverse the linked list, use the algo, and execute are all part of the kernel
### Microkernel
- minimize the size of the kernel by putting non-privileged instructions to the proccess server (storage in user space)
